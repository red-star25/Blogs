- In order to make an application responsive in Flutter, we have widgets like as **MediaQueries**, **LayoutBuilder**, **Expanded**, **Flexible**, and so on.
- In this post, we'll look at the **FractionallySizedBox ** widget, which may help you make your application responsive.
---------
## When to use FractionallySizedBox?
- We use **FractionallySizedBox ** when we wish to offer relative `height`, `width`,`space`.
- The size of the widgets in the Flutter application is determined by **pixel ** values. The difficulty with utilizing pixel values is that they aren't responsive.
- If you're familiar with **CSS**. Then, instead of using `px`, we mostly use `rem`, `em`, and other units. Because the `px` doesn't really adjust to the `width` and `height` of the screen.
- In short, use the **FractionallySizedBox ** widget when you want to give sizes in **percentages **(%).

----------

## How to use FractionallySizedBox?
- **FractionallySizedBox ** is very simple to use. You just wrap the widget within the FractionallySizedBox widget, and then specify the `width` and `height` to size the children of FractionallySizedBox.
- The main properties of FractionallySizedBox are:
<ol>
  <li>
**widthFactor**: It takes `double` value as input. Values between ( 0.0 - 1.0). For example `0.5` means **50%** , `1.0` means **100%**.
</li>
<li>
**heightFactor**: Takes same values as `widthFactor`. But for `height`. 
</li>
<li>
**alignment**: Used to align the `child` of the FractionallySizedBox.
</li>
</ol>
- However, utilizing **FractionallySizedBox ** inside a `Row` or `Column` has one problem. 
- The **FractionallySizedBox ** widget must be wrapped inside the `Flexible` or `Expanded` widget. 
- It's because the `width`¬†and `height`¬†of the Row or Column are not specified usually. As a result, FractionallySizedBox will be perplexed as to what the parent size is. Because **FractionallySizedBox ** sizes its offspring **relatively** to its parent at the end of the day.
- As a result, be sure to specify a size for the Row or Column, or wrap FractionallySizedBox within the **Flexible ** or **Expanded**.
- **FractionallySizedBox **is basically an alternative to **MediaQueries**. It just makes it easier to write, and that's all there is to it!! Because you can accomplish the same thing with MediaQueries as well. As a result, it is entirely up to you to decide which method to employ.

---------
- FractionallySizedBox is used in many ways, For example, giving a `height`, `width`, or `space` between two widgets, etc.
- Let's take an example.
### Use case #1 : Inside the Column/Row
```
class MyHomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text("FractionallySizedBox "),
      ),
      body: Container(
        width:MediaQuery.of(context).size.width,
        height:MediaQuery.of(context).size.height,
        color: Colors.blueGrey,
        child: Column(
        children: [
          Flexible(
            child: FractionallySizedBox(
              widthFactor: 0.8,
              heightFactor: 0.8,
              child: Container(
                color: Colors.orange,
              ),
            ),
          ),
          Flexible(
            child: FractionallySizedBox(
              widthFactor: 0.6,
              heightFactor: 0.6,
              child: Container(
                color: Colors.white,
              ),
            ),
          ),
          Flexible(
            child: FractionallySizedBox(
              widthFactor: 0.4,
              heightFactor: 0.4,
              child: Container(
                color: Colors.green,
              ),
            ),
          )
        ],
      ),
      )
    );
  }
}
```

- As you can see, the sizes provided by the **FractionallySizedBox ** are used by all three **Containers**. Regardless of the screen size, all of these containers will take up the available space.

### Use case #2 : For Giving Spacing
- You can also use FractionallySizedBox to give space between two widget like below :
- 
```
body: Container(
        width: MediaQuery.of(context).size.width,
        height: MediaQuery.of(context).size.height,
        color: Colors.blueGrey,
        child: Column(
          children: [
            Container(
              width: 200,
              height: 50,
              color: Colors.orange,
            ),
            const Flexible(
              child: FractionallySizedBox(
                heightFactor: 0.1,
              ),
            ),
            Container(
              width: 200,
              height: 50,
              color: Colors.white,
            ),
            const Flexible(
              child: FractionallySizedBox(
                heightFactor: 0.2,
              ),
            ),
            Container(
              width: 200,
              height: 50,
              color: Colors.green,
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
```

### Use case #3: For Alignment
- 
```
class MyHomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: const Text("FractionallySizedBox"),
      ),
      body: Container(
        width: MediaQuery.of(context).size.width,
        height: MediaQuery.of(context).size.height/2,
        color: Colors.blueGrey,
        alignment:Alignment.bottomRight,
        child: FractionallySizedBox(
          widthFactor: 0.6,
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed:(){},
            child:Text("Button"),
          )
        )
      ),
    );
  }
}
```
