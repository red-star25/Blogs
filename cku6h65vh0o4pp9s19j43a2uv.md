- In the previous article, we saw how to use `AnimationController` to control our animation. We will further customize our basketball animation in this article.
- The following is an example of our earlier animation:

- Because of the lack of a smooth bouncing effect, the above animation appears strange. Let's make this animation better.
- But first, let's have a look at the basic Animation library that comes along with the Flutter SDK.

---------

## Animation:
- `Animation` is a core library of the Flutter. This is an `abstract` class. It means we won't be able to instantiate it.
- 
![noinstantiate.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1632835759838/TU_C4rVkq.png)
- We can track the animation's **completion **and **dismissal **using an instance of the Animation class. In addition, we can check the **status ** of the currently running animation.
- Let's first create an `Animation` instance in our app.
- 
```
class _MyHomePageState extends State<MyHomePage> with TickerProviderStateMixin {
      late Animation _animation;
  //.....
}
```
- A value of type T is assigned to an animation. It means that we can make an animation for almost any datatypes. For example, we can make:
- 
![animationtype.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1632836557846/IefA6kyCS.png)
- In our case, we want an animation of type `double`. Because we want to translate the ball position which is of type `double`. So let's update the `Animation` type.
- 
```
class _MyHomePageState extends State<MyHomePage> with TickerProviderStateMixin {
      late Animation<double> _animation;
  //.....
}
```
- As previously stated, **Animation ** is an `abstract` class. It has no idea what is going on on-screen. It only understands the `values` that are passed to it and the `state` of that specific animation.
- The **Animation ** provides us with more control over defining the `upperBound` and `lowerBound` values of the animation, i.e. the `begin` and `end` values.
- When the controller plays this animation, it generates **interpolated values ** between the `begin` and `end` points. We use that interpolated value to animate our widget.
- But now comes the question of how to make an animation? To do so, let us first define **Tween**.

---------
## Tween
- **Tween ** animation is an abbreviation for **In-Between** animation. It means that there will only be one `begin` value and one `end` value.
- 
![interpolatedvalues.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1632836668646/YykFeShK_.png)
- And then, with a given duration, animation animate from that `begin` to `end` value.
- **Tween ** animation is primarily used when no **Implicit ** animation is available to meet our requirements.
- There are various types of tweens, such as:
- 
![differentTweens.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1632837254742/Kw0DOY3fJ.png)
- When you have different data types, then you can simply specify that type to the `Tween<T>`. For example: `Tween<double>`
- Let's create one Tween animation for our basketball example. And that is going to be `Tween<double>`.
- 
```
class _MyHomePageState extends State<MyHomePage> with TickerProviderStateMixin {
  late AnimationController _controller;
  late Animation<double> _animation;
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _controller = AnimationController(
      duration: const Duration(milliseconds: 500),
      vsync: this,
    );

    _animation = Tween<double>(begin: 0.0, end: 10.0).animate(_controller);  //here

    _animation .addListener(() {
      setState(() {});
    });
    
     _controller.repeat(reverse: true);
  }
 //....
}
```
- As you can see in the code above, I've chained one more function with the `Tween<double>`, which is **.animate()**. This is because the `Tween<double>` function returns a result of type **Animatable ** rather than **Animation**. So, to retrieve a value of type **Animation**, Tween contains a function called **animate() ** that returns an Animation value.
- Another thing to note is that `.animate()` requires an instance of an **AnimationController ** as an argument. As a result, we've passed our `_controller`.
- Now, if you want to examine the interpolated values of our animation, you can print them out using the _animation.addListener() function:
- 
```
    _animation.addListener(() {
      print(_animation.value);
    });
```
- 
![animationValues.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1632828278316/eR1slefPM.png)
- If you want to use Color as your tween animation you can do something like this :
- 
```
late Animation _colorTween;
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    //...
    _colorTween = ColorTween(begin: Colors.green, end: Colors.blue)
        .animate(_controller);

    _controller.addListener(() {
      print(_animation.value);
    });
    _controller.forward();
  }
```
- 
![colorTween.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1632828605451/YDFrSU68GQ.png)
- As you can see, we now have all of the interpolated values that are in the range of `Colors.green` to `Colors.blue`. How cool is that !! ðŸ¤©

- Let's complete our bouncing ball example by supplying the `_animation.value` in the `Offset`
- 
```
Transform.translate(
          offset: Offset(180.0, _animation.value),
          child: Image.asset(
            "assets/images/basketball.png",
            height: 70,
            width: 70,
            fit: BoxFit.contain,
      ),
)
```

- **Wow, that seems to be working!!** However, the problem from the previous article remains, i.e that the ball bouncing is neither smooth nor feels like a genuine ball bouncing.
- Let's have a look at the `CurvedAnimation` to see how we may address this problem.

--------

## CurvedAnimation
- In Flutter, wherever you use **Animation**, you can also use **Curves**.
- So, what exactly is a `Curves` in animation?
- So far, we've seen animation that moves in a **Linear ** direction at a **Constant Speed**. Where the animation's start and end times are the same.
- We can control the **accelerating **and **deceleration ** of our animation using **CurvedAnimation**.
- **Curves **represent the animation's speed at various points in time during the animation.
- **CurvedAnimation ** accepts three different values:
- **parent**: This is where we specify which curves this animation will apply.
- **curve**: The curve that will be used in the forward direction. In the following example, we'll see a different curve.
- **reverse**: This as the name suggests, reverses the direction of the curves.
- Let's create one `CurvedAnimation` for our Bouncing Ball example:
- 
```
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // ....

    final _curvedAnimation = CurvedAnimation(
      parent: _controller,
      curve: Curves.fastOutSlowIn,
    );
     // give `_curvedAnimation` instance in the `.animate()` instead `_controller`
    _animation =
        Tween<double>(begin: 680.0, end: 400.0).animate(_curvedAnimation);
    // ...
  }
```
- **OUTPUT**:

- In the **CurvedAnimation ** above, I used the `fastOutSlowIn` curve. In Flutter, there are far too many different curves to choose from. You can see more curves by following the link below:

## Summary
- **Animation**: Animation is a core library of the Flutter SDK. It allows you to make an animation for almost any data type. 
- **Tween ** is an abbreviation for In-Between animation, which means there is only one begin value and one end value. 
- In Flutter, wherever you use **Animation**, you can also use **Curves**. Curves represent the animation's speed at various points in time during the animation.
