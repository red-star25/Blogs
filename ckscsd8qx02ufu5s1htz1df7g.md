- Yup, I am talking about the **‚ÄòTop 10 ‚ÄúX‚Äù Sites‚Äô or ‚Äò10 Websites You Don‚Äôt Know Exists'** type of articles. We have seen lots of these types of articles and I decided to take it a step further. 
- There are so many websites out there that can be helpful to developers, but we often overlook them because we haven't heard of them. I will try to gather around 10 unknown or not well-known websites that can be beneficial to any developer.
