# Intro
- When it comes to building an application, Flutter is the easiest and powerful framework. 
- But building an application without any strong **architecture ** is like building a  house without any planning and blueprints.
- 
![KeatonMovingGIF.gif](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1630676281108/A2-tuR8fM.gif)
- You won't understand the uses of architecture when building small applications.
- But when it comes to building a **big production level application** where you have ***many screens***, ***animations***, ***methods***, ***classes***, etc, without any proper  *architecture* you will end up in a state where everything is messed up and you don't know how all the **components**, **classes**, **methods **are communicating and functioning.
- 
![RoughDayKeyboardGIF.gif](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1630675814826/Y3MzftV6U.gif)
- So it is very necessary to **maintain the code** make code **more readable** and **testable**, and **easily trackable** when designing and developing this kind of big application.
- There are many different packages available, and all have their own way to handle application states.
- In this article, I am going to talk about `Bloc`. **Bloc** is not just a *state management*, but it's also an **architectural design pattern** which helps us to build production-level applications.


---------

## What is Bloc?
- **Bloc** stands for **B**usiness **Lo**gic **C**omponent.
- 
![image.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1630500978617/KxVcmml9D.png)
- In computer software, business logic or domain logic is the part of the program that encodes the real-world business rules that determine how data can be created, stored, and changed. - wiki
- **Bloc ** separates the UI from the **business logic**. When we build an application without any architecture, we most probably write our logic directly inside the UI. But when we use **Bloc** we have to write the business logic in a separate file, i.e separated from UI and then we link it to the UI.
- **Bloc** makes the application easily testable, fast, reactive.
- The Bloc is distinguished into four layers - 
### üñºÔ∏è **UI** (Presentation Layer) :
- All the component(Widgets) of the app which is visible to the user is defined here.
- 
![weatherapp.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1630678347567/0kb7BvhhJ.png)
### ü¶æ**Bloc** (Business Logic Layer): 
- It acts as a middle man between **UI** and **Data** layer, Bloc takes an event triggered by the user (ex: GetWeatherData button press, Submit form button press, etc) as an input, and responds back to the UI with the relevant state.
- 
![bloc.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1630759925545/xl7zSsTNd.png)
 ### ‚öôÔ∏è**Data Layer** :
- This layer has further two parts. **Repository** and **Data Provider**. 
- 
![datalayer.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1630760119531/G57ZpzUNp.png)
- **Data Provider** - This layer retrieves/fetches the raw data from different data sources (ex: different APIs, DBs, Network, Shared preferences, etc). For example: If you are building a weather app. Then you might use external APIs like **OpenWeatherAPI**, from where you will get raw data. You can have `GET`, `POST`, `DELETE`, etc methods inside this class. For example, To get the `raw` data from `OpenWeatherMap` API we can do something like
```
// weather_data_provider.dart
class WeatherDataProvider {
  Future<http.Response> getRawWeatherData(String city) async {
    http.Response rawWeatherData = await http.get(
      Uri.parse("Url"),
    );
    return rawWeatherData;
  }
}
```
```
//Sample Raw Data looks like this
{
  "weather": [
    {
      "id": 800,
      "main": "Clear",
      "description": "clear sky",
      "icon": "01d"
    }
  ],
  "main": {
    "temp": 282.55,
    "feels_like": 281.86,
    "temp_min": 280.37,
    "temp_max": 284.26,
    "pressure": 1023,
    "humidity": 100
  },
  "name": "Mountain View", 
} 
```
- **Repository** - This layer contains one or more than one **Data Providers**. The transformation is done on the `raw` data returned by the **Data Provider** in this layer. (For ex: converting the `raw` into some kind of Model). **Bloc** communicates with this layer when the user requests the data. This layer requests raw data from the **Data Provider** and after that, this layer performs some kind of transformation. For example, converting `raw` weather data to `WeatherModel`.
```
// weather_repository.dart
class WeatherRepository {
  late final WeatherDataProvider weatherDataProvider;
  Future<Weather> getWeather(String location) async {
    final http.Response rawWeather =
        await weatherDataProvider.getRawWeatherData(location);
    final json = jsonDecode(rawWeather.body);
    final Weather weather = Weather.fromJson(json);
    return weather;
  }
}
```
- This **Repository** layer directly communicates with **bloc** in order to pass data
- 
![process.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1630760858463/DhlxyX80i.png)
- The above figure is showing exactly how every layer is communicating with each other.
- There are two very important terms that you need to understand : **Event** and **State**. 
### **Event** 
- Event is nothing but different actions (button click, submit, etc) triggered by the user from UI. It contains information about the action and gives it to the **Bloc** to handle.
### **State** 
- The UI will update according to the `State` it receives from the **Bloc**. For example, there could be different kinds of states - <br>
> **LoadingState **- Will Show Progress Indicator <br>
> **LoadedState **- Will Show Actual widget with data<br>
> **ErrorState **- Will show an error that something went wrong. 
> ![states.gif](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1630510170048/BOpzdKg93.gif)
- Okay, so now we've covered all the basic concept that is required to understand in order to implement bloc in flutter application. **If you have still not understood or had any confusion, don't worry it'll be cleared when we see an example**.
- So let's make a simple app by using all the concepts that we've learned so far.
> **Note: If you don't know about `Streams` then please learn it first as it is the base of the **bloc**, I'll not cover it in this article as I've already covered it in my previous article, So make sure you check it.**

## Implementing Bloc:
- Before diving into implementation **VS Code** has a very handy extension for Bloc. Make sure you install it.
- %[https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=FelixAngelov.bloc]
---
### Step 1: Create a Flutter Application
- 
```
flutter create bloc_example
```
----
### Step 2: Project Setup
- `main.dart`
- 
```
void main() {
   runApp(MyApp());
}
```
```
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: WeatherApp(),
    );
  }
}
```
---
- `weather_app.dart`
- 
```
class WeatherApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text("Weather App"),
        centerTitle: true,
      ),
      body: Padding(
        padding: EdgeInsets.symmetric(horizontal: 12.0),
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.spaceAround,
          children: [
            TextField(
              decoration: InputDecoration(
                hintText: "Enter city name",
                border: OutlineInputBorder(),
              ),
            ),
            Column(
              children: [
                Image.asset(
                  "assets/images/sun.png",
                  height: 200,
                  width: 200,
                ),
                SizedBox(
                  height: 20,
                ),
                Text(
                  "New York",
                  style: Theme.of(context).textTheme.headline3,
                ),
                SizedBox(
                  height: 5,
                ),
                Text(
                  "38",
                  style: Theme.of(context).textTheme.headline4!.copyWith(
                      fontWeight: FontWeight.bold, color: Colors.black),
                ),
              ],
            ),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {},
              child: Text("Get Weather"),
            )
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```
### Final UI
- 

![starterproject.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1630762641885/bJXmYUbCD.png)

--------

## Step 3: Install packages
- Go to `pubspec.yaml` and add [flutter_bloc](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_bloc), [bloc](https://pub.dev/packages/bloc), and [http](https://pub.dev/packages/http) packages inside `dependencies`
```
dependencies:
    flutter:
      sdk: flutter
    flutter_bloc: ^7.1.0
    bloc: ^7.1.0
    http: ^0.13.3
```

-----

## Step 4: Create `bloc` files
- Now right click on the `lib` folder of your application, here you'll see `Bloc: New Bloc` option if you've installed the `bloc` extension that I've mentioned earlier.
- 
![bloc_create.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1630591370096/8l4jfLvLi.png)
- After clicking on this, the dialog will pop up for giving the name to the bloc. Give the name and press Enter.
- 
![bloc_create_name.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1630762939731/OSwSTCp0Z.png)
- Now If you see in the `lib` directory the folder named `bloc` is created and it has 3 different file - `weather_bloc`, `weather_event`, and `weather_state`

- ### `weather_bloc.dart` :
- 
```
import 'dart:async';
import 'package:bloc/bloc.dart';
import 'package:meta/meta.dart';
part 'weather_event.dart';
part 'weather_state.dart';
```
```
class WeatherBloc extends Bloc<WeatherEvent, WeatherState> {
  WeatherBloc() : super(WeatherInitial());

  @override
  Stream<WeatherState> mapEventToState(WeatherEvent event) async* {
    // TODO: implement mapEventToState
  }
}
``` 
- As you can see the extension has already generated some code for us. So let's try to understand what this code means.
- The `weather_bloc.dart` class is a bridge between our **UI** and the **Data** class, In other words, this class will handle all the **Events ** triggered by the User and sends the relevant **State** back to the UI.
- 
![bloc.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1630763741763/k7oYHPZeN.png)
- We are extending our `WeatherBloc` class with `Bloc` which takes two things `WeatherEvent` and `WeatherState`. As the name suggests, they handle the applications **State** and **Events** respectively.
- These two classes are implemented in the `weather_event.dart` and `weather_state.dart` respectively.
- In the second line the `constructor` of our class is created. In this, we need to provide an `initial` state. It's not going to do anything. It simply represents that the app is now in its **initial stage** and nothing has happened yet.
- After that, we have to implement the `mapEventToState` method. As the name suggests, It will **Map the Events to State**. In other words, what this is gonna do is, It's gonna take some kind of `Event` (ex: *Increment Counter* event, *Get Weather* event, *Decrement Counter* event, etc). And it's our responsibility to write the functionality of what suppose to happen after that event is triggered.
- And what `state` is going to result as an effect of that event.
- Now let's implement **weather_event.dart** and **weather_state.dart** first and then we will come back and implement this `mapEventToState` method.

-------
- ### `weather_event.dart` :
- 
```
/*import statements*/
part of 'weather_bloc.dart';
```
```
@immutable
abstract class WeatherEvent {}
class WeatherRequest extends WeatherEvent {
  final String cityName;

  WeatherRequest({required this.cityName});
}
```
- In this class, we define different kinds of events by extending the abstract event class. 
- For example, when the user presses the `Get Weather` button, the *WeatherRequest* event is triggered.
- Here I've also created a final field called `cityName`. It's nothing but a **string** inputted by the user in the search text field.
- We have to pass it to the event in order to access it in our bloc.
- Now let's implement `weather_state.dart` class
------
- ### `weather_state.dart` :
- 
```
/*import statements*/
part of 'weather_bloc.dart';
```
```
@immutable
abstract class WeatherState {}
class WeatherInitial extends WeatherState {}
class WeatherLoadInprogress extends WeatherState {}
class WeatherLoadSuccess extends WeatherState {
  final Weather weather;
  WeatherLoadSuccess({required this.weather});
}
class WeatherLoadFailure extends WeatherState {
  final String error;
  WeatherLoadFailure({required this.error});
}
```
- In this class, we define different kinds of states (For example, *LoadingInProgress* state, *LoadSuccess* state, *LoadFailure* state).
- For example, your app is fetching user data from an external API. Now when the user requests their data, initially we pass**LoadingInProgress** which represents that the data is currently loading and we can show **ProgressIndicator** in UI. After data is received we change the state and pass the **LoadSuccess** state with the requested data. And if for some reason, something went wrong or some error occurred then we will pass **LoadFailure** for showing the user that the app has failed to fetch data.
- In our case, we have 4 states - 
- **WeatherInitial** - For initial stage
- **WeatherLoadInprogress** - For telling the app that weather data is in progress, 
- **WeatherLoadSuccess** - After weather data has been received we change our UI state and show the temperature data of the specified city.
- **WeatherLoadFailure** - For Error handling .
- Now that we've implemented all the `Events` and `States`. We can now go to `weather_bloc.dart` and can start implement `mapEventToState`method.
----

### Back to `weather_bloc.dart`:
- So now that we have **Events**, we can now handle those events and perform our operation.
- 
```
class WeatherBloc extends Bloc<WeatherEvent, WeatherState> {
  final _weatherRepository = WeatherRepository();
  WeatherBloc() : super(WeatherInitial());

  @override
  Stream<WeatherState> mapEventToState(WeatherEvent event) async* {
    if (event is WeatherRequest) {
      yield WeatherLoadInprogress();

      try {
        final weatherResponse =
            await _weatherRepository.getWeather(event.cityName);
        yield WeatherLoadSuccess(weather: weatherResponse);
      } catch (e) {
        yield WeatherLoadFailure(error: e.toString());
      }
    }
  }
}
```
- Here we are handling different events with `if-else if-else`. You can use `switch-case too`.
- In this, we check for different events and return the relevant states to the UI.
- In our case, we are checking if the `Event` is `WeatherRequest`, then we have to first of all pass the `WeatherLoadInProgress` state that tells the app that data is currently fetching.
- And after receiving the response from the **Repository** we can then pass the **WeatherLoadSuccess** state with the data, and update the UI state.
- Now the final step is to provide this data to the UI. Let's do this.
----

## Step 5: How to access `bloc` data in UI?.
- Now that we have created the bloc and implemented all the functionalities
we need to somehow provide this bloc to the widget tree so that we can use the `weather` data and display it on the screen. And also we have to bind the `Get Weather` button.
- Before that, we have to understand different **Widgets** provided by **bloc** - 
- **BlocProvider**, **BlocBuilder**, **BlocListener**, **BlocConsumer**, **RepositoryProvider**.
-------
### BlocProvider
- **BlocProvider** widget provides a bloc to its children (i.e Widgets).
- **BlocProvider** is used as dependency injection (DI) widget so that a single instance of a bloc can be provided to multiple widgets within a subtree.
- If you don't know about **Dependency Injection**, you can check this out -
- %[https://dhruvnakum.xyz/master-the-art-of-dependency-injection]
- Okay. So now we know what **BlocProvider** does, where can we put it?
- We have to put it at the place from where all the children can access the bloc. Can you guess that place?
- 
![GuessGIF.gif](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1630601445817/O2ghS8BgB.gif)
- Its non-other than our favorite **MaterialApp** üéâüéâ
- So let's wrap the **BlocProvider** inside **MaterialApp**
- Go to `main.dart`.
- 
```
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return BlocProvider(
      create: (context) => WeatherBloc(),
      child: MaterialApp(
        home: WeatherApp(),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```
- That's it. Now we can access our bloc via `BlocProvider.of<WeatherBloc>(context)`.
- **BlocProvider** has one `lazy` parameter. By default, it's `true`. It is used to lazily load the `bloc`. It means whenever anyone tries to use the `bloc` then it will be initialized.
- To override this functionality we can change the value of `lazy` to `false`.
- Now you might have asked a question, that what if we have **multiple blocs**. How can we provide all the bloc from the `main.dart`?
- One way is to nest all the bloc one inside another - 
- 
```
BlocProvider(
    BlocProvider(
      BlocProvider(
          .....
```
- 
![MinionWhatGIF.gif](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1630766848752/oT6DrkTAY.gif)
- üòÖ Don't be scared. There is an easy approach. **Don't use this**

### MultiBlocProvider
- **Bloc** provides us a **MultiBlocProvider** widget that takes a List of Bloc and provides it to its children. Let me demonstrate.
- 
```
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MultiBlocProvider(
      providers: [
        BlocProvider(create: (context) => WeatherBloc(),),
        BlocProvider(create: (context) => NetworkBloc(),),
        BlocProvider(create: (context) => StorageBloc(),),
      ],
      child: MaterialApp(
        home: WeatherApp(),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```
- Isn't it cool? That's the power of MultiBlocProvider ü¶æ

-----

### BlocBuilder:
- **BlocBuilder** is a widget that helps **Re-building** the UI based on **State changes**.
- In our case we want our UI to update the state when the user presses the `Get Weather` button.
- **BlocBuilder** builds the UI every single time **state changes**
- So, it's very necessary to place **BlocBuilder** around the **Widget** that we want to rebuild.
- You can also wrap the whole Widget inside the **BlocBuilder** (i.e around the Scaffold), but it's not a good way. Because think about the time and processing power that will be consumed when your whole widget tree rebuilds just to update a Text widget inside the tree. So make sure you wrap the **BlocBuilder** around the widget that needs to be rebuild when the state changes.
- In our case, we have to update the whole page. Because when the user presses the `GetWeather` button we want to show a **Circular Progress Indicator** instead of what we have previously.
- So let's add **BlocBuilder** inside the `body`
- 
```
body: BlocBuilder<WeatherBloc, WeatherState>(
        builder: (context, state) {
          return ...
     }
)
```
- **BlocBuilder** takes two things `bloc`, and `state`. 
- `builder` function is **required** which takes two parameters. **context** and the `state` which is of type `WeatherState` in our case. And it should return **Widget** in response.
- We can explicitly provide the `bloc` in **BlocBuilder** by passing the bloc inside `bloc` property of **BlocBuilder**
- 
```
BlocBuilder<WeatherBloc, WeatherState>(
  bloc: blocA, // provide the local bloc instance
  builder: (context, state) {
     return ...
  }
)
```
- If the bloc parameter is omitted, BlocBuilder will automatically perform a lookup using BlocProvider and the current BuildContext.
- Only specify the bloc if you wish to provide a bloc that will be scoped to a single widget and isn't accessible via a parent BlocProvider and the current BuildContext.
- `buildWhen` parameter takes the previous bloc state and current bloc state and returns a boolean. If `buildWhen` returns true, `builder` will be called with state and the widget will rebuild. If `buildWhen` returns false, `builder` will not be called with state and no rebuild will occur.
- 
```
BlocBuilder<WeatherBloc, WeatherState>(
  buildWhen: (previousState, state) {
  },
  builder: (context, state) {
    return ...
  }
)
```
- We can conditionally render our widget based on the state with the help of the `state` parameter. Let's conditionally render the widget of our weather app based on different states. And call the **WeatherRequest** event on the `Get Weather` button press.
- 
```
BlocBuilder<WeatherBloc, WeatherState>(
        builder: (context, state) {
          if (state is WeatherLoadInprogress)
            return Center(
              child: CircularProgressIndicator(),
            );
          else if (state is WeatherLoadFailure)
            return Center(
              child: Text("Something went wrong"),
            );
          else if (state is WeatherLoadSuccess)
            return WeatherWidget()
          else
            return Container();
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}
```
- You can access your **Bloc** by - **BlocProvider.of<WeatherBloc>(context)** or **context**.
- 
```
context.read<WeatherBloc>().add(Event());
// or
BlocProvider.of<WeatherBloc>(context)add(Event())
```
-------

### BlocListener:
- As the name suggests, this will listen to any state change as **BlocBuilder** does.
- But instead of building the widget like **BlocBuilder**, it takes one function, `listener`, which is called only **once per state**, not including the initial state.
- Example: Navigation, Showing a SnackBar, Showing a Dialog, etc...
- It also has a `bloc` parameter. Only specify the `bloc` if you wish to provide a bloc that is otherwise not accessible via BlocProvider and the current BuildContext.
- The `listenWhen` parameter is the same as **BlocBuilder**'s `buildWhen` but for **Listener**.
- The whole idea of **BlocListener** is - It is not responsible for **building/updating** the widget like **BlocBuilder** does. 
- It only listens to the  **state** changes and performs some operation. The operation could be (Navigating to other screens when state changes, Showing Snackbar on a particular state, etc).
- Let's say we want to **show a snackbar on WeatherLoadInProgress** state -
- Wrap the body inside **BlocListener**
```
body: BlocListener<WeatherBloc, WeatherState>(
        listener: (context, state) {
          if (state is WeatherLoadInprogress) {
            ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
              SnackBar(
                content: Text("Loading"),
              ),
            );
          }
      },
  child : BlocBuilder<WeatherBloc, WeatherState>(
      builder: // ...
    )
)
```
- **Output**:
-

------
### MultiBlocListener:
- **MultiBlocListener ** is a Flutter widget that merges multiple BlocListener widgets into one. **MultiBlocListener ** improves the readability and eliminates the need to nest multiple BlocListeners
- By using MultiBlocListener we can go from:
- 
```
BlocListener<BlocA, BlocAState>(
  listener: (context, state) {},
  child: BlocListener<BlocB, BlocBState>(
    listener: (context, state) {},
    child: BlocListener<BlocC, BlocCState>(
      listener: (context, state) {},
      child: ChildA(),
    ),
  ),
)
```
- **to**
- 
```
MultiBlocListener(
  listeners: [
    BlocListener<BlocA, BlocAState>(
      listener: (context, state) {},
    ),
    BlocListener<BlocB, BlocBState>(
      listener: (context, state) {},
    ),
    BlocListener<BlocC, BlocCState>(
      listener: (context, state) {},
    ),
  ],
  child: ChildA(),
)
```

----------

### BlocConsumer:
- As of now we are building a widget using **BlocBuilder** and showing the snackbar using **BlocListener**.
- Is there any easy way to combine both in a single widget? **Hell yeah üòé**
- **Bloc** provide **BlocConsumer** widget, which combines both **BlocListener** and **BlocBuilder**.
- So instead of writing **BlocListener** and **BlocBuilder** separately we can do - 
- 
```
BlocConsumer<BlocA, BlocAState>(
  listener: (context, state) {
   if (state is WeatherLoadInprogress) {
     ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
       SnackBar(
         content: Text("Loading"),
        ),
      );
     }
  },
  builder: (context, state) {
    // return widget 
  }
)
```
- An optional `listenWhen` and `buildWhen` can be implemented for more granular control over when listener and builder are called.

-------

### RepositoryProvider:
- It is the same widget as **BlocProvider**. 
- But the main difference is **BlocProvider** provides a single instance of `bloc` to its children whereas **RepositoryProvider** provides `repositories` to its children.
- It is used as a dependency injection (DI) widget so that a single instance of a repository can be provided to multiple widgets within a subtree. 
- If you want to know more about **dependency injection** - 
- %[https://dhruvnakum.xyz/master-the-art-of-dependency-injection]
- Example:
- 
```
RepositoryProvider(
  create: (context) => WeatherRepository(),
  child: ChildWidget(),
);
```
- Widget can access this repository by - 
```
context.read<WeatherRepository>();
// or
RepositoryProvider.of<WeatherRepository>(context)
```

------
### MultiRepositoryProvider:
- As the name suggests, it provides multiple repositories.
- Example:
- 
```
MultiRepositoryProvider(
  providers: [
    RepositoryProvider<RepositoryA>(
      create: (context) => RepositoryA(),
    ),
    RepositoryProvider<RepositoryB>(
      create: (context) => RepositoryB(),
    ),
    RepositoryProvider<RepositoryC>(
      create: (context) => RepositoryC(),
    ),
  ],
  child: ChildA(),
)
```

## Step 6: Final Step
- Now by using the above knowledge of **BlocBuilder**, **BlocProvider**, **BlocListener**, etc we can now complete our weather app.
- So Let's first provide our bloc :
- **main.dart** 
- 
```
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return BlocProvider(
      create: (context) =>
          WeatherBloc()..add(WeatherRequest(cityName: "Ahmedabad")),
      child: MaterialApp(
        home: WeatherApp(),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```
- Here I've added an **Event** `WeatherRequest` when calling **WeatherBloc**, because we want the initial city to show. here I've provided a static city name. You can take the user's current location and provide it here to show the initial location of the user.
- Wrap `body` inside **BlocConsumer** and add **WeatherRequest** Event on button click to fetch new city weather: 
- **weather_app.dart**
- 
```
class WeatherApp extends StatelessWidget {
  final _cityController = TextEditingController();
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      resizeToAvoidBottomInset: false,
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text("Weather App"),
        centerTitle: true,
      ),
      body: BlocConsumer<WeatherBloc, WeatherState>(
        listener: (context, state) {
          if (state is WeatherLoadInprogress) {
            ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
              SnackBar(
                content: Text("Loading"),
              ),
            );
          }
        },
        builder: (context, state) {
          if (state is WeatherLoadInprogress)
            return Center(
              child: CircularProgressIndicator(),
            );
          else if (state is WeatherLoadFailure)
            return Center(
              child: Text("Something went wrong"),
            );
          else if (state is WeatherLoadSuccess)
            return Padding(
              padding: EdgeInsets.symmetric(horizontal: 12.0),
              child: Column(
                mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.spaceAround,
                children: [
                  TextFormField(
                    controller: _cityController,
                    decoration: InputDecoration(
                      hintText: "Enter city name",
                      border: OutlineInputBorder(),
                    ),
                  ),
                  Column(
                    children: [
                      Image.asset(
                        "assets/images/sun.png",
                        height: 200,
                        width: 200,
                      ),
                      SizedBox(
                        height: 20,
                      ),
                      Text(
                        state.weather.name,
                        style: Theme.of(context).textTheme.headline3,
                      ),
                      SizedBox(
                        height: 5,
                      ),
                      Text(
                        state.weather.main["temp"].toString(),
                        style: Theme.of(context).textTheme.headline4!.copyWith(
                            fontWeight: FontWeight.bold, color: Colors.black),
                      ),
                    ],
                  ),
                  ElevatedButton(
                    onPressed: () {
                      if (_cityController.text.isNotEmpty) {
                        context.read<WeatherBloc>().add(
                              WeatherRequest(
                                cityName: _cityController.text,
                              ),
                            );
                      }
                    },
                    child: Text("Get Weather"),
                  )
                ],
              ),
            );
          else
            return Container();
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}

## Folder Structure For Bloc:
- 
![bloc_folder_structure.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1630828407007/KmfWTISHd.png)
- In `business_logic` folder you can provide all your bloc.
- In `data` folder we have `data_provider` where you provide different providers, `model` where you define your data model, and `repositories` folder where you define all the repositories.
- In `presentation` folder you can have `screen` folder, `pages`, `widgets` folder where you implement UI.

## Wrapping Up
- **Bloc** pattern is quite hard to understand as it involves advance many concepts. But as soon as you start using it and playing around with it, you'll definitely master it. **Trust me**.
- When I started learning **Bloc**, trust me it took a lot of time to understand all the concepts. But as soon as I started using it by making small applications it felt easy.
- So, my advice is to start applying the concepts you have learned in this article by making small applications.
- **Hope this article helped to clear your doubts and concepts about Bloc**. **If It did then make sure you share it with others**.
- **And also don't forget to share your feedback in the comment**.
- **Thanks for reading** üòÄ. **See you in the next article**
- **Until then...**
