## Setting up Google Pay

### Creating a Google Pay merchant account

> Note: If you just want to **test** GPay, this step is not required. You can directly move to 'Installing the Pay plugin' Section.

* Creating a Google Pay merchant account is the first step in integrating the google payment option into your app.
    
* Head over to [Google Pay & Wallet Console](https://pay.google.com/business/console/). You will see a dialog in which you need to specify your business name and country.
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1673977758375/7b93b76e-700e-4865-94d5-fe8f825e3e98.png align="center")
    
* After entering your Business details you will be redirected to the Dashboard of the Google Pay Console.

### Verifying Business Profile

* Now that we have created a Business in GPay Console, we need to set up the Business Profile.
    
    > This is mandatory if we need to enable all Pay & Wallet Console features in our app.
    
* Click on the **Business Profile** section on the left of the Dashboard.
    
* You will see 2 sections :
    
    * Business Identity and
        
    * Business Information.
        

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1673978066062/9f508380-def8-4d80-b0ea-0f691827e52f.png align="center")

* Let's first fill Business Information.
    

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1673978565350/68e67813-010e-4cf7-ac68-5d7967ab2b86.png align="center")

* Now let's fill in **Business Information**
    

> You will see different form that you need to fill according to your selected Country.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1673979025820/68834256-903a-4aed-9236-0d57dd0d6574.png align="center")

> Please note that: I've entered dummy info, just to show you. You need to fill valid information, otherwise it will not get approved.

* Okay, so after filling in all the details hit the **Save** button. After a few minutes, your business profile will be approved. If not, you can contact them via e-mail.
    
* You will see the approved label right after Business Profile.

## Installing the Pay plugin

* Okay, so now that we've done the setup in Google Pay Console. We are ready to use Google Pay in our Flutter App.
    
* We are going to the use [**pay**](https://pub.dev/packages/pay) package to add support for payments.
    
* So, head over to `pubspec.yaml` and add this package :
    

```yaml
dependencies:
    pay: <latest-version>
```

---

## Configuring the plugin and integrating it into the app

* After adding the package, we need to provide a configuration file of Google Pay.
    
* There are two ways to provide this file:
    
    * From locally and
        
    * From the Remote Server.
        
* We are going to provide this file locally as of now. So, create a `assets` folder inside your root directory and create `gpay.json` file and paste the below JSON in it:
    

```json
{
  "provider": "google_pay",
  "data": {
    "environment": "TEST",
    "apiVersion": 2,
    "apiVersionMinor": 0,
    "allowedPaymentMethods": [
      {
        "type": "CARD",
        "tokenizationSpecification": {
          "type": "PAYMENT_GATEWAY",
          "parameters": {
            "gateway": "example",
            "gatewayMerchantId": "gatewayMerchantId"
          }
        },
        "parameters": {
          "allowedCardNetworks": ["VISA", "MASTERCARD"],
          "allowedAuthMethods": ["PAN_ONLY", "CRYPTOGRAM_3DS"],
          "billingAddressRequired": true,
          "billingAddressParameters": {
            "format": "FULL",
            "phoneNumberRequired": true
          }
        }
      }
    ],
    "merchantInfo": {
      "merchantId": "01234567890123456789",
      "merchantName": "Example Merchant Name"
    },
    "transactionInfo": {
      "countryCode": "US",
      "currencyCode": "USD"
    }
  }
}
```

* `environment` : Please change this when you are ready to ship your app.
    
* `allowedPaymentMethods` : You can configure here, which payment methods are allowed in GPay.
    
* `merchantInfo` : Do not forget to update this when you are ready to ship. You can get `merchantId` and `merchantName` in your Google Pay Console.
    
* `transactionInfo` : Here you can mention the currency code. ex: USD, EUR, INR, etc.
    

> Reminder: Do not forget to add `assets` folder in `pubspec` file.

## Creating a payment button and handling payment responses

* There are two ways through which we can handle payment using `pay` package.
    
    1. Using the Pre-Built Button Widget or
        
    2. By Manually triggering the Payment Process.
        
* Let's Look at the 1st way:
    

### 1\. GooglePay Widget

* The pay package provides a GooglePay Button which does all the heavy lifting for us. Let's put it to use.
    

```dart
import 'package:pay/pay.dart';

class HomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  const HomePage({super.key});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      body: Center(
        child: GooglePayButton(
          paymentConfigurationAsset: 'gpay.json',
          paymentItems: const [
            PaymentItem(
              label: 'Total',
              amount: '10.00',
              status: PaymentItemStatus.final_price,
            )
          ],
          type: GooglePayButtonType.pay,
          margin: const EdgeInsets.only(top: 15.0),
          onPaymentResult: (result) {
            log(result.toString());
          },
          loadingIndicator: const Center(
            child: CircularProgressIndicator(),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

* That's it. That's all you need to do to initiate the payment.
    
* But there is one little issue. When you try to run the app, you will get an error saying:
    
* You need to set `minSdkVersion` to at least `19` . To resolve that head over to `android/app/build.gradle` and update `minSdkVersion` to `19`.
    
    ```dart
        defaultConfig {
            applicationId "com.example.payment"
            minSdkVersion 19   //flutter.minSdkVersion
            targetSdkVersion flutter.targetSdkVersion
            versionCode flutterVersionCode.toInteger()
            versionName flutterVersionName
        }
    ```
    
* Now Finally, Let's run the app. Hopefully, there is no error now ü§ûüèª.

* Okay, Let's Try to tap on the button and see if it initiates the Payment or not.
    
* As the Recording is getting blacked out when I tap on the Button, Also cannot take a Screenshot due to security reasons, I'm sharing a photo taken from another phone üòÖ.

    * If you are in Testing Environment, you need to join [this](https://groups.google.com/g/googlepay-test-mode-stub-data) group with the same email in order to use test cards.
        
    * For more on Test Card visit [this page](https://developers.google.com/pay/api/web/guides/resources/test-card-suite).
        

### Handling Response

* After pressing the **Continue** button, if the transaction was successful you will receive a success response as shown below:
    

```json
{
  "apiVersion": 2,
  "apiVersionMinor": 0,
  "paymentMethodData": {
    "description": "Visa‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢1111",
    "info": {
      "billingAddress": {
        "address1": "1600 Amphitheatre Parkway",
        "address2": "",
        "address3": "",
        "administrativeArea": "CA",
        "countryCode": "US",
        "locality": "Mountain View",
        "name": "Card Holder Name",
        "phoneNumber": "6505555555",
        "postalCode": "94043",
        "sortingCode": ""
      },
      "cardDetails": "1111",
      "cardNetwork": "VISA"
    },
    "tokenizationData": {
      "token": "examplePaymentMethodToken",
      "type": "PAYMENT_GATEWAY"
    },
    "type": "CARD"
  }
}
```

* In the `tokenizationData` there is our `token` which we can use further to place orders for example.
    

### 2\. Manual Payment Handling

* This is a more advanced use case, where you are given more control over handling each request and button individually. Let's also see this.
    
* First of all, we need to create a `Pay` client object.
    

```dart
 Pay payClient = Pay.withAssets(['gpay.json']);
```

* This `payClient` has a method named **userCanPay()** which is basically used to determine whether the user can start a payment process with a given provider.
    
* So let's use this method and show our UI according to its state. As this method returns future, we are going to use `FutureBuilder`
    
    ```dart
    class HomePage extends StatefulWidget {
      const HomePage({super.key});
    
      @override
      State<HomePage> createState() => _HomePageState();
    }
    
    class _HomePageState extends State<HomePage> {
      late Future<bool> _userCanPay;
    
      Pay payClient = Pay.withAssets(['gpay.json']);
    
      @override
      void initState() {
        _userCanPay = payClient.userCanPay(PayProvider.google_pay);
        super.initState();
      }
    
      @override
      Widget build(BuildContext context) {
        return Scaffold(
          body: Center(
            child: Visibility(
              visible: Platform.isAndroid,
              child: FutureBuilder(
                future: _userCanPay,
                builder: (BuildContext context, AsyncSnapshot snapshot) {
                  if (snapshot.connectionState == ConnectionState.done) {
                    if (snapshot.data == true) {
                      return ElevatedButton(
                        child: const Text('Pay With GPay'),
                        onPressed: () async {},
                      );
                    } else {
                      // userCanPay returned false
                      // Consider showing an alternative payment method
                    }
                  }
                  return Container();
                },
              ),
            ),
          ),
        );
      }
    }
    ```
    
    * Let's run the app to see if the button actually shows up or not.
        

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1674296792246/f95776dc-3745-4cfe-916a-1e623d3e3a4d.png align="center")

* ü•≥ Cool. Now that the button is visible, Let's initiate the payment.
    
* To initiate the payment sheet, we need to use `showPaymentSelector` method from the **payClient** object.
    
    ```dart
     ElevatedButton(
        onPressed: () async {
          final result = await payClient.showPaymentSelector(
                            provider: PayProvider.google_pay,
                            paymentItems: [
                              const PaymentItem(
                                amount: '50.00',
                                status: PaymentItemStatus.final_price,
                              )
                            ],
                          );
                          log(result.toString());
        },
       child: const Text('Pay with GPay',),
    ),
    ```
    
    Output:

> Important: If you are going for the 2nd approach, you will need to follow [Google's Design guidelines](https://developers.google.com/pay/api/android/guides/brand-guidelines) and [API guidelines](https://developers.google.com/pay/api/android/reference/client). Otherwise your application might get rejected from the Play Store.
