## 7.[AWS Open Guide](https://github.com/open-guides/og-aws)
- A lot of information on AWS is already written. Most people learn AWS by reading a blog or a ‚Äúgetting started guide‚Äù and referring to the standard AWS references. Nonetheless, trustworthy and practical information and recommendations aren‚Äôt easy to come by. AWS‚Äôs own documentation is a great but sprawling resource few have time to read fully, and it doesn‚Äôt include anything but official facts, so omits experiences of engineers. The information in blogs or Stack Overflow is also not consistently up to date.
- This guide is by and for engineers who use AWS. It aims to be a useful, living reference that consolidates links, tips, gotchas, and best practices. It arose from discussion and editing over beers by several engineers who have used AWS extensively.
