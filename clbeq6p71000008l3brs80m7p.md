## Previously...

*   Greetings! Appreciate you taking the time to read this piece. If you have been following the Flutter Riverpod series, you may have read the preceding article on Providers.
    
*   In the article before this one, we discussed Providers, developed a basic Provider, and learned about the **ConsumerWidget**.
    
*   We also took a look at the **Ref** and some of its applications. If you haven't read the article yet, it's highly recommended that you do so.
    
    %[https://dhruvnakum.xyz/flutter-riverpod-a-guide-to-provider] 
    
*   Now, in this article, we are going to review the different types of Providers made available by Riverpod; these are quite powerful and make it easier to handle the state of the application.
    
*   So, let's get started!
    

* * *

## StateProvider

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1670137861555/x35sGyFb3.png align="left")

*   In the article prior to this, we got an introduction to Provider. The Provider allows its listener to access the data and the values cannot be altered since they are read-only.
    
*   Nevertheless, in many practical scenarios, the values may vary due to the user's interaction.
    
*   **StateProvider** comes to our rescue as it lets us **modify** its value. So, if you are dealing with basic values such as a *string*, *boolean*, *integer*, *enumeration*, etc, you can easily manage them with **StateProvider**.
    
*   Let's take a look at an example to understand how this works.
    
*   Suppose we have an application that collects data from an API. When the user presses the Load Data button, we need the loader to appear.
    
*   To achieve this, we require a boolean state that can determine if the loading is in progress or not so that the loader is visible to the user.
    

```dart
final isLoadingProvider = StateProvider<bool>((ref) {
  return false;
});
```

*   In the above snippet, we have created a StateProvider of type **boolean** which initially returns a value **false.**
    

```dart
class HomePage extends ConsumerWidget {
  const HomePage({super.key});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context, WidgetRef ref) {
    // 1 --------------------------------------
    final isLoading = ref.watch(isLoadingProvider);
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: const Text('Riverpod'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        // 2 --------------------------------------
        child: !isLoading 
            ? ElevatedButton(
                child: Text(
                  'Load Data',
                  style: Theme.of(context)
                      .textTheme
                      .bodyText1
                      ?.copyWith(color: Colors.white),
                ),
                onPressed: () {
                  // 3 --------------------------------------
                  ref.read(isLoadingProvider.notifier).state = true;
                  Future.delayed(const Duration(seconds: 3), () {
                    ref.read(isLoadingProvider.notifier).state = false;
                  });
                },
              )
            : const CircularProgressIndicator(),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

1.  Initially, we take advantage of [ref.watch](http://ref.watch) to monitor the state of the provider. As soon as the *isLoadingProvider* variable is altered, the widget is reconstructed.
    
2.  Subsequently, we use the *isLoading* value to conditionally render the Loader.
    
3.  Lastly, within the *onPressed* callback of the ElevatedButton, we modify the value of the provider.
    
    *   Pay attention to the syntax we are using:
        
    
```dart
    ref.read(isLoadingProvider.notifier).state = true;
```
    
*   In this what we are actually doing is, we are accessing the **<mark>notifier</mark>,** and saying just give me the current snapshot of the provider as it is, and using this snapshot we can access the **<mark>state</mark>** of that provider and mutate it.

> **StateProvider** is useful where you have simple state like boolean, integer, string,etc.
> 
> **Avoid** using StateProvide when your state is a complex object (such as a custom class, a list/map, ...), the logic for modifying your state is more advanced.

* * *

## StateNotifier & StateNotifierProvider

*   We have already discussed how StateProvider can be beneficial when dealing with basic states such as Boolean, Integer, and String.
    
*   But, how can we handle more complicated states such as lists, maps, and custom classes?
    
*   This is where **StateNotifier** and **StateNotifierProvider** become necessary.
    

### StateNotifier:

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1670137961773/Zr7NHOdsC.png align="left")

*   This is an observable class that can store one single state.
    
*   StateNotifier is designed to be subclassed, which means you need to extend your class with this class. For example:
    

```dart
class FruitsNotifier extends StateNotifier<List<String>> {}
```

*   The code line mentioned above implies that your class now comprises a state with the type List&lt;String&gt;. When this state is assigned a fresh value, the widgets which are observing it will be reconstructed.
    
    > It is essential to note that when you extend your class with StateNotifier, you must pass the initial value in the constructor, or else you will encounter an error. So let's provide the initial value.
    

```dart
class FruitsNotifier extends StateNotifier<List<String>> {
  FruitsNotifier() : super(['Apple', 'Banana']);
}
```

*   After providing initial values, now you can use this class as a normal class, you can write methods to allow other objects to modify your state which is List&lt;String&gt;.
    
*   For example:
    

```dart
class FruitsNotifier extends StateNotifier<List<String>> {
  FruitsNotifier() : super(['Apple', 'Banana']); // Initializing List.

  void add(String name) {
    state = [...state, name];
  }

  void remove(String name) {
    state = [...state.where((element) => element != name)];
  }

  void update(String name, String updatedName) {
    final updatedList = <String>[];
    for (var i = 0; i < state.length; i++) {
      if (state[i] == name) {
        updatedList.add(updatedName);
      } else {
        updatedList.add(state[i]);
      }
    }
    state = updatedList;
  }
}
```

*   The StateNotifier allows access to the state variable from within the class, so we can call up the list of fruits by simply inputting the ***state*** and assign a new value.
    
*   We have assigned our *state* a different value in the three methods.
    
*   This is essential since changing the state directly will not reconstruct the UI.
    
*   Therefore, when we update the state of *FruitNotifier* through any of its methods or by giving it a new value, it will automatically alert the listeners and rebuild the UI.
    
*   How can one access this state though outside this class? That's where StateNotifierProvider comes in.
    

### StateNotifierProvider

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1670138076008/40ygDtp7c.png align="left")

*   Once we are done with the StateNotifier, we can create a StateNotifierProvider.
    
*   **StateNotifierProvider** is a provider that is used to listen to and expose a StateNotifier.
    
*   Let's create a provider for our FruitProvider:
    

```dart
final fruitsProvider =
    StateNotifierProvider<FruitsNotifier, List<String>>((ref) {
  return FruitsNotifier();
});
```

*   Here, we need to define two things:
    
    *   The **notifier** itself and (FruitesNotifier)
        
    *   The actual data type of the state (List&lt;String&gt;).
        
*   Let's complete the example by displaying this list of fruits on a screen.
    

```dart
class HomePage extends ConsumerWidget {
  const HomePage({super.key});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context, WidgetRef ref) {
    final fruits = ref.watch(fruitsProvider);
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: const Text('Riverpod')),
      floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
        onPressed: () {
          ref
              .read(fruitsProvider.notifier)
              .add('Fruit ${Random().nextInt(100)}');
        },
        child: const Icon(Icons.add),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          children: fruits
              .map(
                (e) => GestureDetector(
                  onLongPress: () {
                    ref
                        .read(fruitsProvider.notifier)
                        .update(e, '$e updated');
                  },
                  onTap: () {
                    ref.read(fruitsProvider.notifier).remove(e);
                  },
                  child: Text(e),
                ),
              )
              .toList(),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

*   The **.notifier** allows us to access all of the methods contained in our StateNotifier.
    
*   We are able to add items by pressing the FloatingButton and executing the **add()** method, and then, by tapping the item, the **remove()** method is called.
    
*   The **update()** is triggered through a long press.
    
*   Every time one of these methods is used, a rebuild will occur if the state has changed in any way.

## FutureProvider

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1670138173091/mFUyiW4X_.png align="left")

*   If you are calling an API to get the data, then using **FutureProvider** is a better option.
    
*   FutureProvider is mainly used for this type of scenario where your code is asynchronous. Let's understand this using an example:
    

```dart
final userProvider = FutureProvider.autoDispose<List<User>>((ref) async {
  final dioClient = ref.read(dioClientProvider);
  final res = await dioClient.get('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users');
  return (res.data as List).map((e) => User.fromJson(e)).toList();
});
```

*   As you can see, we are calling JSON placeholder api to get the list of users. And after getting the data we are simply returning the value.
    

> I've used a modifier with FutureProvider \`autoDispose\`. We will learn more about modifier later. For the time being just know that it is used dispose the listener whenever the provider is no longer in use.

*   Now, that we've created a provider, we want to listen to that provider's state. You can do that by using **.watch()** just like below.
    

```dart
class HomePage extends ConsumerWidget {
  const HomePage({super.key});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context, WidgetRef ref) {
    final user = ref.watch(userProvider); // <====
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: const Text('Riverpod'),
      ),
      body: ...
    );
  }
}
```

*   Now here is a twist, if you hover over the *user* variable you will see it is of type <mark>AsyncValue </mark> . So why is that? Why we are not directly getting the value?
    
*   [AsyncValue](https://pub.dev/documentation/riverpod/latest/riverpod/AsyncValue-class.html) is basically a class that is used to safely manipulate asynchronous data.
    
*   By using AsyncValue, you are guaranteed that you cannot forget to handle the loading/error state of an asynchronous operation.
    
*   So, we can use <mark>.when</mark> to convert an AsyncValue into either a *progress indicator*, *an error screen*, or *to show the data*:
    

```dart
class HomePage extends ConsumerWidget {
  const HomePage({super.key});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context, WidgetRef ref) {
    final user = ref.watch(userProvider);
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: const Text('Riverpod'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: user.when(
          data: (data) {
            return Column(
              children: data.map((e) => Text(e.name ?? '')).toList(),
            );
          },
          error: (error, stackTrace) {
            return Text(error.toString());
          },
          loading: () => const CircularProgressIndicator(),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

*   This will automatically rebuild the UI when the Future completes.
    

* * *

## StreamProvider

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1670138383325/YqstoLv0D.png align="left")

*   StreamProvider is used to watch a Stream of results from a realtime API and reactively rebuild the UI.
    
*   This is usually used where we want to:
    
    *   listen to Firebase or web-sockets
        
    *   rebuild another provider every few seconds
        
*   Example:
    

```dart
final authStateChangeProvider = StreamProvider.autoDispose<User?>((ref) {
  final firebaseAuth = ref.watch(firebaseAuthProvider);
  return firebaseAuth.authStateChanges();
});
```

*   And to use this inside the widget :
    

```dart
Widget build(BuildContext context, WidgetRef ref) {
  final authStateAsync = ref.watch(authStateChangesProvider);
  return authStateAsync.when(
    data: (user) => user != null ? HomePage() : SignInPage(),
    loading: () => const CircularProgressIndicator(),
    error: (err, stack) => Text('Error: $err'),
  );
}
```

* * *
