## A bit about Myself

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1671032189638/gG2oG1U8V.jpg align="center")

*   Hi there üëãüèª, Dhruv here. I am a Flutter developer with over 3 years of experience.
    
*   I was very excited when the **#DevRetro2022** campaign was introduced because it gave me the opportunity to reflect on my journey as a developer over the past years and share my experiences and key milestones with others.
    
*   Writing this blog has been a great way for me to look back on my journey and think about the progress I have made as a developer.
    
*   I am excited to share my experiences with you and hope that it will inspire others to continue learning and growing as developers.

## How I Started My Development Journey?

### Fascination with programming

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1671035895333/bMXexlVDC.gif align="center")

*   When I first started, I was completely new to the world of programming. I had no experience with coding and didn't even know where to start. But I was fascinated by the idea of creating things using code, and I was determined to learn.
    

### Starting college

*   I started college in 2018, studying Computer Science and engineering. In my third year, my college organized a hackathon, and I decided to participate even though I didn't know anything about app development. (Finger Crossed üòÖ)

### Struggles with Native Android

*   We got a task to develop an app using Native Android. I was completely clueless, but my friend knew a bit about it so we tried our best to complete it. By **We** I mean my Friend üòÅ. Cuz I didn't know how all that things work lol.
    
*   I saw my friend coding the app, and I also got interested so I also tried coding small-small tasks with his help, but I found it very difficult to understand, and in the end, I gave up ü•≤.
    

### Introduction to cross-platform development

*   That's when a senior of mine suggested that I try cross-platform development, such as React Native or Flutter. And Guess, what I picked?

    **Flutter üíô.**
    

### Learning new languages and technologies

*   Parallelly, I was also trying different programming languages and technologies. I learned about JavaScript, React.js as I also got interested in Web Development. So I started experimenting with simple coding projects.
    
*   At first, it was a struggle. I had to wrap my head around complex concepts and syntax, and I spent hours over documentation, youtube videos, StackOverflow, etc trying to understand how everything worked. But as I continued to learn and practice, I started to make progress.
    

### Focus on Flutter

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1671036373771/YYdsjrB9k.png align="center")

*   Eventually, I settled on Flutter for mobile development, and I began focusing on learning that.
    
*   The course that I took to learn Flutter is by **Angela Yu** on Udemy. The course is designed very well and her teaching is top-notch. I highly recommend it to everyone who just started learning Flutter or wants to start.
    
    %[https://www.udemy.com/course/flutter-bootcamp-with-dart/] 
    
*   After completing the course, I started making small applications and published four of them on the Play Store within six months.
    
*   That was my first big achievement ü•≥. Because developing an app to publish to the play store is a big task for any developer.
    
*   However, I realized that my development was lacking proper architecture and code maintenance, so my code was not organized well.
    
*   Also One of the biggest challenges for new developers in Flutter is state management, and at the time, the popular solution was Provider.
    
*   The course covered Provider, but I struggled to understand it due to my weak programming concepts.
    
*   So, I studied general programming architectures and concepts to better understand what was happening under the hood. Over time, I became more comfortable with these concepts.
    

### Tough time never lasts.

*   It was not an easy journey for me. Looking back on my journey, I am proud of the progress I have made and the things I have been able to create.

## How and Why I Started Blogging?

### My lack of experience in writing

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1671035735267/Qnwmz6QSX.gif align="center")

*   Starting my blogging journey was not an easy task. I had no connection with writing by the way, but I wanted to share whatever I was learning.
    
*   Youtube was one option but I was not into video-making things, that's why I decided to write. I was never sure if I was good enough to start a blog. However, I took the risk and decided to give it a try.
    

### The motivation behind starting a blog

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1671035585271/iuLVgBv0h.gif align="center")

*   I started a blog with the intention of documenting the things I was learning so that I could refer back to them and share them with others.
    
*   At the time, I was confident with my knowledge of Flutter, so I started with beginner-level blogs on the topic.
    

### The challenges I faced starting a blog

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1671035501942/gKdiDB7z6.png align="center")

*   I had to do a lot of research and learn new things in order to come up with interesting topics to write about. But with time, I started to get a better understanding of advanced Flutter concepts and gained confidence in my writing skills.
    
*   Initially, I was not getting views on the blogs that I was writing. So, I started to share my blogs on various social media platforms like Twitter, LinkedIn, Discord, Slack, Reddit, etc, which helped to increase my reach and visibility.
    
*   Over time, I gained a loyal following and my blogs started to get more views and engagement.
    

### The success

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1671035664196/SfmbS0qMf.gif align="center")

*   Currently, I have over **200k+** **views** on my blogs, and **1.8k+ followers,** and written **70+ articles** on various topics related to Flutter.
    
*   I am happy that I took the first step in starting my blogging journey and am grateful for the support and feedback I have received from my readers.
    

### Anybody Can Write

*   In conclusion, starting a blog can be challenging, but with dedication, hard work, and a willingness to learn and improve, anyone can start their own blogging journey.

## A Flashback Of 2022

*   In 2022, I was thrilled to start working as a full-time Flutter developer. I had been working with Flutter for a while and was excited to put my skills to the test professionally.
    
*   I quickly adapted to my new job and also started receiving freelance clients as well.
    
*   I enjoyed the challenge of working on different projects and learning from my co-developers.
    
*   My blog, which I had started as a hobby, was also gaining traction and I was receiving a lot of positive feedback from my readers.
    
*   In addition to my work, I made some great friends online and we would often chat and support each other in our respective fields.
    
*   Overall, it was a very fulfilling and productive year for me. I was able to grow professionally and personally, and I felt proud of the progress I had made.
    

## What's the Plan for 2023?

*   As a developer, there are many things we can do to stay up-to-date and continue to improve our skills. There are number of things that I want to try in 2023. Here are some of them:
    
    *   I want to try the latest developments and trends, such as new frameworks, and tools.
        
    *   I want to attend conferences, meetups, and workshops related to Flutter or development in general.
        
    *   I want to contribute to well-known open-source projects. Hope I will do this in 2023.
        
    *   And of course last but not least I am hoping to achieve the milestone of reaching over 1 million views on my blog ü§ûüèª and also to have my blog featured on Hashnode ü•π.

## Conclusion

*   My journey as a developer and blogger has been one of dedication, hard work, and continuous learning.
    
*   Starting as a complete beginner, I faced challenges but gained a lot of experience and confidence.
    

### My Message to New Developers

*   Starting coding can be challenging, but it is also an incredibly exciting journey. As a beginner, it is important to be patient and not get discouraged.
    
*   It will take time to understand complex concepts and gain experience, but the effort will be worth it trust me.
    
*   Also, surround yourself with supportive and knowledgeable individuals who can help guide you on your path.
    
*   Take advantage of online resources and communities to learn and grow, and **never stop pushing yourself to improve**.
    
*   **Good luck on your journey! YOU CAN DO IT!!!**
