- This is Part - 4 of **Slivers in Flutter** series. Make sure you check the first 3 parts.
- In this article, I'm going to explain some of the useful `Sliver` widgets, which are -
**SliverOpacity**, 
**SliverAnimatedOpacity**, 
**SliverFadeTransition**, 
**SliverVisibility**, 
**SliverIgnorePointer**, 
**SliverSafeArea**.
--------

## SliverOpacity
- The `SliverOpacity` makes `sliver` widget transparent.
- This works the same as the `Opacity` widget works for `Box` widgets. The difference is this only works on the `Sliver` widgets.
- It usually takes values between `0.0` to `1.0`.
- For the value 0.0, the sliver child is simply not painted at all. For the value 1.0, the sliver child is painted immediately.
- For values of `opacity` other than `0.0` and `1.0`, this class is relatively expensive because it requires painting the sliver child into an intermediate buffer.
- Example :

--------

## SliverAnimatedOpacity
- If you see in the output of the above example, The opacity is directly jumping from `no visibility` to `full visiblity`. It's not looking smooth.
- To do the smooth transition between `0.0` to `1.0` values we have to use `SliverAnimatedOpacity`.
- `SliverAnimatedOpacity` is an animated version of `SliverOpacity` which automatically transitions the sliver child's opacity over a given `duration` whenever the given opacity changes.
- **Example**

--------

## SliverFadeTransition
- This also animates the `opacity` of the `sliver` widget. The only difference is it takes `Animation<double>` value instead of `double` values.
- **Example**
%[https://gist.github.com/red-star25/d9b9c4dd269075872fde30d3410da965]
**Output** :
-

- Here I've used `Curves.fastOutSlowIn` animation. You can use any one of the curves defined in the below class:

-------

## SliverVisibility
- `SliverVisibility` is the same as the `Visibility` widget except it takes `sliver` as a child.
- It is used to show or hide a sliver child. When the `sliver` is not visible the `replacementSliver` is included instead.
- `replacementSliver` is used when the `sliver` child is not visible, assuming that none of the `maintain` flags (in particular, `maintainState`) are set.
- `SliverVisibility` has different parameters like :
- **maintainAnimation** : It is used to determine whether to maintain `animations` within the sliver subtree when it is not visible.
- **maintainInteractivity**: It is used to determine whether to allow the sliver to be interactive when hidden.
- **maintainSemantics**:  It is used to determine whether to maintain the semantics for the sliver when it is hidden (e.g. for accessibility).
- **maintainSize**: It is used to determine whether to maintain space for where the sliver would have been.
- **maintainState**: It is used to determine whether to maintain the State objects of the sliver subtree when it is not visible.
- **replacementSliver**: Widget defined here is visible when sliver is not visible.
- **Example**:

--------

## SliverIgnorePointer
- When you want your sliver to ignore the tapping or any kind of interaction then simply wrap your `sliver` widget inside `SliverIgnorePointer`.
- It will disable the interaction of that widget.
- When `ignoring` property is `true`, the widget is not interactable. And when `ignoringSemantics` property is true, the subtree will be invisible to the semantics layer
- **Example**:

**Output**:

---------

## SliverSafeArea
- If you've used `SafeArea` then, `SliverSafeArea` is also doing the same thing except it takes `sliver` as a child instead of `Box` widget.
- For example, this will indent the sliver by enough to avoid the status bar at the top of the screen.
- It will also indent the sliver by the amount necessary to avoid The Notch on the iPhone X or other similar creative physical features of the display.
