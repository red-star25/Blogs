## 1. AutoRoute
- If your App requires deep-linking or guarded routes or just a clean routing setup you'll need to use named/generated routes and youâ€™ll end up writing a lot of boilerplate code for mediator argument classes, checking for required arguments, extracting arguments, and a bunch of other stuff. AutoRoute does all that for you and much more.
