## Introduction

Hey there üëãüèª Welcome back to part two of the journey through Clean Architecture, or a big hello if you're here for the first time. I'm really glad you decided to check out this article, and I promise you won't regret it.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1710953199389/58cef8a2-f407-47ff-ba9d-c823974093f1.gif align="center")

## Recap of the first article

If you're new to this Clean Architecture series, I've already covered the basics of Clean Architecture. Here's a quick summary:

* We started by talking about why Clean Architecture is important.
    
* Next, we looked at the three main parts of Clean Architecture:
    
    * **Presentation**
        
    * **Domain**
        
    * **Data layer**
        
* We explored each layer in detail, explaining what each one does, and using examples to help understand their roles and responsibilities.
    
* If you have not checked it yet go ahead and take a look at it:
    

%[https://dhruvnakum.xyz/becoming-an-expert-in-flutter-with-clean-architecture-a-comprehensive-guide] 

> Pre-requisites: The pre-requisite for reading this article is above blog on Clean Architecure and a basic knowledge of Flutter.

---

## In this article...

* This blog I will show you how to organize your project's folders for Clean Architecture, based on what we covered in the first article.
    
* We'll use [flutter\_bloc](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_bloc) for managing states. If you're not familiar with Bloc, it's okay. You can use any state management method that fits with Clean Architecture.
    
* So, without further ado, let's dive in.
    

---

## Project Setup

* First of all, go to a directory of your choice and hit the below command in termial to create a flutter project.
    
    ```bash
    flutter create my_app
    ```
    
* After creating a project let's now go ahead and add a required dependency. Head over to `pubspec.yaml` and add the below dependencies:
    

```dart
dependencies: 
    data_connection_checker_tv: ^0.3.5-nullsafety // For checking internet connectivity 
    flutter_screenutil: ^5.9.0 // For creating responsive 
    dio: ^5.4.1 // For making http requests 
    get_it: ^7.6.7 // For dependency injection 
    logger: ^2.1.0 // For logging debug 
    flutter_bloc: ^8.1.4 // For State management 
    equatable: ^2.0.5 // For value based equality 
    dartz: ^0.10.1 // For functional programming 
    go_router: ^13.2.0 // For managing routing 
    hive: ^2.2.3 // For local data storage 
    hive_flutter: ^1.1.0 // For local data storage
```

Also, add following dependencies in `dev_dependencies`:

```dart
dev_dependencies: 
    flutter_test: 
    flutter hive_generator: ^2.0.1 // For generating hive classes 
    build_runner: ^2.4.8 // For code generation
```

* Okay so now that we are all set let's see what the folder structure looks like of Clean Architecture.
    

---

## Folder Structure

* In Clean Architecture, the primary two folders contain most of the necessary components are:
    
    * **core**
        
    * **features**
        
* We also have other folders like `common_widgets`, `di`, `routes`, and a `app` folder. Let's create each folder under the lib folder.
    

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1711004265535/fb9f44da-6b0d-4441-848d-647240fc111c.png align="center")

* Let's look at what each folder does:
    

---

#### features

* This is the core of Clean Architecture, where we put into practice everything discussed in the first blog about Clean Architecture.
    
* Okay so let's understand this. Our app has different parts, right? Like Login, SignUp, Home, Settings, Product, etc.
    
* For each part, we make a separate folder in a feature folder.
    
* Inside this, we create **three** more folders:
    
    * **data,**
        
    * **domain, and**
        
    * **presentation**
        
* Yes, these folders are exactly what we talked about in the previous blog.
    
* So as an example, Let's make a feature called **Counter**.
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1711274907399/b6e7b67d-55b7-48e2-b76d-cf6e854d5410.png align="center")
    
* Cool! Now let's dive deep into each folder and understand how to implement it.
    

##### **domain**

* From what we learned in the last article, this layer is at the heart of Clean Architecture. It acts as a bridge between the *presentation* and *data* layers.
    
* We'll make 3 more folders named **Entities, Repositories, and Usecases** and create respectively `.dart` files in them.
    

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1711274851772/58b999ed-e52e-4046-a6ce-d39c36873c1d.png align="center")

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: Since we'll be coding everything in the next article, I won't be showing all the code with you right now otherwise this blog will become lengthy. So Let's just focus on the structure and how it will look.

```dart
// counter_entity.dart
class CounterEntity extends Equatable {
    //...    
}
```

* So, for the counter feature, we've created **CounterEntity** which we'll be using across the presentation layer.
    

```dart
// counter_repository.dart
abstract class CounterInfoRepository {
    //...
}
```

* Remember the Repository from the last blog? It's an abstract class that acts as a blueprint for our data layer's repository. So in CounterRepository, we will be creating all the abstract functions.
    

```dart
// get_count_info.dart
class GetCountInfo {
  final CounterInfoRepository counterRepository;

  GetCountInfo({required this.counterRepository});
   
  //...
}
```

* Lastly, there's the GetCountInfo use case. It's basically a specific action the user will do, like getting info on a number.
    

---

##### **data**

* The data layer in Clean Architecture manages the app's data. It links the repository layer, which serves as the entry point, to actual data sources such as databases, files, and APIs.
    
* We'll make three folders we're already familiar with: **datasources, models,** and **repositories**.
    

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1711277472981/1dc6223f-7fd0-4903-ab15-85cf62d2c03a.png align="center")

* In the `datasources` folder, we have two files. One is for remote data, which uses `DioClient` to get the data and send it to the repository. The other is for local data, which uses `Hive` to cache, save, and get the data. Let's take a look at the code.
    

```dart
// counter_local_data_source.dart

abstract class CounterLocalDataSource {
  Future<void> cacheCountInfo({required CounterModel? counterToCache});
  Future<CounterModel?> getCountInfo();
}

class CounterLocalDataSourceImpl implements CounterLocalDataSource {
  @override
  Future<CounterModel?> getCountInfo() async {//...}

  @override
  Future<void> cacheCountInfo({required CounterModel? counterToCache}) async {//...}
}
```

```dart
// counter_remote_data_source.dart

abstract class CounterRemoteDataSource {
  Future<Response> getCounterInfo({required int count});
}

class CounterRemoteDataSourceImpl implements CounterRemoteDataSource {
  final _dioClient = getIt.get<DioClient>();

  @override
  Future<Response> getCounterInfo({required int count}) async {//..}
}
```

* Now let's create a model class. Models act like blueprints for things in real life within our code. We use them to turn raw data from these data sources into a format that Dart can understand and use where needed.
    

```dart
class CounterModel extends CounterEntity {
  const CounterModel({required super.countInfo});

  factory CounterModel.fromJson({required String json}) {
    return CounterModel(countInfo: json);
  }

  CounterModel copyWith({String? countInfo}) {
    return CounterModel(countInfo: countInfo ?? this.countInfo);
  }
}
```

* Lastly, create a repository implementation class. This class will handle all the business logic, from fetching data from data sources, converting it into a model, and then passing it to the domain layer with proper error handling.
    

```dart
class CounterRepositoryImpl implements CounterInfoRepository {
  final CounterRemoteDataSource remoteDataSource;
  final CounterLocalDataSource localDataSource;
  final networkInfo = getIt.get<NetworkInfo>();

  CounterRepositoryImpl({
    required this.remoteDataSource,
    required this.localDataSource,
  });

  @override
  Future<Either<Failure, CounterModel>> getCountInfo(
      {required int count}) async {//...} 
  }
}
```

* As you can see, we have expanded our repository implementation class with the domain layer's repository and implemented the method `getCountInfo`.
    

---

##### **presentation**

* This layer connects your user to the application. It mainly consists of three parts: **business logic, pages,** and **widgets.** Let's create those folders and files.
    

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1711278788933/a1a12a0a-4beb-4e11-bc7e-5c99e616ad5d.png align="center")

* If you're using flutter\_bloc, put your business logic in the cubit/bloc folder like I did. If not, you can make a folder for your own state management.
    
* And in pages and widgets, it's simple, you code all the UI-related stuff
    

---

So, that was the main part of the Clean Architecture which we just finished. Now, let's go through the responsibilities and uses of other folders one by one.

---

#### app

* This folder contains the entry widget of the application. We use this app widget in the `main.dart` file's `runApp()` function.
    
* So, make a file named `app.dart` and copy the following code into it:
    

```dart
class App extends StatelessWidget {
  const App({super.key});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return ScreenUtilInit(
      designSize: const Size(390, 844),
      builder: (_, __) => MaterialApp.router(
        debugShowCheckedModeBanner: false,
        locale: const Locale('en', 'US'),
        title: kAppName,
        theme: themeData,
        routerConfig: router,
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

* Here, we've defined all the basic elements such as `routing`, `localisation`, `screen utils`, and more. Simple, right? Okay, let's move forward now.
    

---

#### common\_widget

* It's where we put all the widgets that are used all over our app. These are the widgets we need to use again and again on different pages and in different situations.
    
* To make it clearer, some widgets in this folder are the **Appbar**, which gives a consistent top navigation bar on different screens; the **BottomNavBar**, which lets users easily move between the main features of the app from the bottom of the screen; and the **Drawer**, a menu that slides out and can be accessed from many places in the app.
    

---

> **‚ö†Ô∏è NOTE:** I won't paste the entire code of each file here because some files have a lot of lines. You'll be able to access this code at the end of this blog. So stay tuned and let's keep going.

#### core

* *As the name suggests, this section defines all the core functionalities of the application, such as*`constants`, `network`, `local db`, etc. Let's now break down this folder and see what it contains:
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1711007018924/3eb795ac-9564-41cd-bd3e-2c39c905dddf.png align="center")
    
    ##### **base (optional):**
    
* I made this folder because I'm using **flutter\_bloc** in this project for managing states.
    
* This folder contains a bloc class called `base_bloc.dart` and a state class called `base_state.dart`.
    
* Essentially, this will serve as the foundation for all the cubits we plan to create.
    
    ```dart
    class BaseBloc extends BlocObserver {
      @override
      void onEvent(Bloc bloc, Object? event) {
        super.onEvent(bloc, event);
      }
    
      @override
      void onTransition(Bloc bloc, Transition transition) {
        super.onTransition(bloc, transition);
      }
    
      @override
      void onError(BlocBase bloc, Object error, StackTrace stackTrace) {
        super.onError(bloc, error, stackTrace);
      }
    }
    ```
    
* Similarly, we will create a state class where we will define common states as shown below:
    
    ```dart
    abstract class BaseState extends Equatable {}
    
    class StateInitial extends BaseState {
      @override
      List<Object> get props => [];
    }
    class StateOnSuccess<T> extends BaseState {
      final T response;
      StateOnSuccess(this.response);
      @override
      List<Object?> get props => [];
    }
    
    //...define other state
    ```
    
    ---
    
    ##### **connection**
    
* Remember we added the `data_connection_checker_tv` package in `pubspec.yaml`? We'll create a class named `NetworkInfo` to handle connectivity logic and use this package.
    

```dart
abstract class NetworkInfo {
  Future<bool>? get isConnected;
}

class NetworkInfoImpl implements NetworkInfo {
  final DataConnectionChecker connectionChecker;

  NetworkInfoImpl(this.connectionChecker);

  @override
  Future<bool> get isConnected => connectionChecker.hasConnection;
}
```

* Whenever we need to check device connectivity, we can use `isConnected`, a boolean.
    

> üí°Use Case: You will see the use of this in the Data Layer's Repository Implementation.

---

##### **Constant**

* In this section, we set up all the app-level constants such as colors, text, themes, fonts, and more.
    

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1711184608705/98f8a134-ce97-4aa4-8e73-cf0073313957.png align="center")

---

##### **Errors**

* In this folder, we have two files
    
* **Exception -** This file lists the Remote and Local errors we could encounter when making API calls or fetching local data
    
    ```dart
    // exceptions.dart
    class ServerException implements Exception{}
    class CacheException implements Exception{}
    ```
    
* **Failure -** We're using `dartz`, a package for functional programming, so we'll return two things from a function. If you're not familiar with functional programming, don't worry. We'll cover what we need to know in the next article.
    
* We have different types of failures, such as *ServerFailure*, *CacheFailure*, *NetworkFailure*, and more. We define all these types in this class and use them.
    

```dart
    abstract class Failure {
      final String errorMessage;
      const Failure({required this.errorMessage});
    }
    
    class ServerFailure extends Failure {
      ServerFailure({required String errorMessage})
          : super(errorMessage: errorMessage);
    }
    
    //..Other failures
```

* ---
    
    ##### **local**
    
    * We use **Hive** to store and fetch local data. We've created a helper class to manage all the local database-related tasks.
        
    
* ```dart
          class HiveHelper {
            static init() async {
              await Hive.initFlutter();
              // register hive adapters
              await openBox();
            }
          
            static openBox() async {
                 // Open Hive boxes
            }
          }
    ```
    

---

#### **network**

* In this folder, we define everything related to networking such as network *Clients*, *Endpoints*, and *Interceptors*. We have created three folders for these:
    
    * **client**
        
    * **endpoints**
        
    * **interceptors**
        
* Let's explore each one and learn what they do.
    
    ---
    
    ##### **client**
    
    * In this folder, we will define our **dio client** which we will be using to make API calls.
        
    
    ```dart
    // dio_client.dart
    
    class DioClient {
      // dio instance
      final Dio _dio;
    
      // injecting dio instance
      DioClient(this._dio) {
        _dio
          ..options.baseUrl = Endpoints.baseUrl
          ..options.connectTimeout =
              const Duration(milliseconds: Endpoints.connectionTimeout)
          ..options.receiveTimeout =
              const Duration(milliseconds: Endpoints.receiveTimeout)
          ..options.responseType = ResponseType.json
          ..interceptors.add(DioInterceptor())
          ..interceptors.add(LogInterceptor());
      }
    
      Future<Response> get(...) async {...}
    
      Future<Response> post(...) async {...}
    
      Future<Response> put(...) async {...}
    
      Future<Response> delete(...) async {...}
    }
    ```
    
    * We've made a **DioClient** class that includes all the necessary network calls such as `get`, `post`, `put`, `delete`.
        
    * There's also a `dioexception` class for managing network errors and sending formatted messages to the user.
        
    * Let's create it too.
        

```dart
// dio_exceptions.dart

class DioExceptions implements Exception {
  late String message;

  DioExceptions.fromDioError(DioException dioError) {
    switch (dioError.type) {
      case DioExceptionType.cancel:
        message = "Request to API server was cancelled";
        break;
      // Handle other DioError
  }

  String _handleError(int? statusCode, dynamic error) {
    switch (statusCode) {
      case 400:
        return error['message'] ?? 'Bad request';
      // Handle other status code
    }
  }
}
```

---

##### **Interceptor**

* The app often includes an authentication module where users register and log in.
    
* To prevent unauthorized access, we require an access token for every request. Instead of manually adding the access token to every API call, which can be time-consuming, we use an interceptor to handle it automatically.
    
* For more information about interceptors, read this blog:
    
* %[https://dhruvnakum.xyz/networking-in-flutter-interceptors] 
    
* Let's create a **Dio Interceptor**
    

```dart
class DioInterceptor extends InterceptorsWrapper {
  @override
  void onRequest(
      RequestOptions options, RequestInterceptorHandler handler) async {
    log("Request[${options.method}] => PATH: ${options.path}");
    // Pass accessToken in header of every request
    super.onRequest(options, handler);
  }

  @override
  void onResponse(Response response, ResponseInterceptorHandler handler) {
    log("Response Status Code: [$response]");
    super.onResponse(response, handler);
  }

  @override
  void onError(DioException err, ErrorInterceptorHandler handler) {
    log("Error[${err.response?.statusCode}] => PATH: ${err.requestOptions.path}");
    super.onError(err, handler);
  }
}
```

* Now to use this, visit our **DioClient** class\*\*.\*\* There you will see we added this interceptor.
    

---

##### **Endpoints**

* In a production app, we'll have many APIs to work with. To organize all the API URLs and their endpoints, we create a separate class called *Endpoints*. This way, we can easily access the base URL and API endpoints.
    
* Let's create it.
    

```dart
class Endpoints {
  Endpoints._();

  // base url
  static const String baseUrl = "";
  // receiveTimeout
  static const int receiveTimeout = 150000;
  // connectTimeout
  static const int connectionTimeout = 15000;

  // endpoints
  static const String login = "$baseUrl/login";
}
```

We've finally finished the **core** folder. I hope you now understand what's inside each folder and their responsibilities.

Let's move on and explore the other folders.

---

#### DI (Dependency Injection)

* Dependency injection is a way to organize your code so that a class gets its dependencies from somewhere else instead of making them itself. This means your class doesn't have to set up these dependencies; they are given to it by something called an injector.
    
* If you want to learn more about dependency injection, you can check this blog as it will explain to you from the core what is DI and why we need it.
    

%[https://dhruvnakum.xyz/master-the-art-of-dependency-injection] 

* In the context of Clean Architecture, we've made classes like DioClient, NetworkInfo, Hive, etc. Instead of creating a new instance of these classes every time, we inject them at the start of the app and use the same instance everywhere in the app.
    
* Later, we'll add more components like Repository, Data sources, Usecases, etc. We'll inject these into our business logic too, which is why we use dependency injection.
    
* For Flutter, there's a package called [**get\_it**](https://pub.dev/packages/get_it) that helps with this.
    
* Remember the **di** folder in the lib folder? We'll create a `service_locator.dart` class there to set this up.
    

```dart
final getIt = GetIt.instance;

Future<void> setupLocator() async {
  await HiveHelper.init();

  getIt.registerLazySingleton<Dio>(() => Dio());
  getIt.registerLazySingleton<DioClient>(() => DioClient(getIt<Dio>()));

  getIt.registerLazySingleton<NetworkInfo>(
      () => NetworkInfoImpl(DataConnectionChecker()));
}
```

* Now whenever we want to use any of these we use it like this:
    

```dart
final dioClient = getIt.get<DioClient>();
```

That's it. As simple as that.

---

#### routes

* We use the [go\_router](https://pub.dev/packages/go_router) package for routing in Flutter. It makes navigating between screens easy by using URLs.
    
* We'll make a `path.dart` file to list all the paths used in the app.
    

```dart
class Paths {
  static const loginPage = '/login';
  static const homePage = '/home';
}
```

* Now let's create `routes.dart` file where will define `router` for our application:
    

```dart
final router = GoRouter(
  initialLocation: Paths.login,
  routes: [
    GoRoute(
      path: Paths.login,
      builder: (context, state) => const LoginPage(),
    ),
    GoRoute(
      path: Paths.home,
      builder: (context, state) => const HomePage(),
    ),
  ],
);
```

* We pass this `router` in MaterialApp.router() 's `routeConfig` parameter like this
    

```dart
MaterialApp.router(
        // other config
        routerConfig: router,
),
```

---

#### main.dart

* `main.dart` is the starting point of the application.
    
* Here, we set up a logger for debugging, decide the app's orientation, and adjust other settings before the app runs.
    

```dart
final logger = Logger();

Future<void> main() async {
  runZonedGuarded(
    () async {
      WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
      await setupLocator();

      service.SystemChrome.setPreferredOrientations(
          [service.DeviceOrientation.portraitUp]).then((_) {
        runApp(const App());
      });
    },
    (error, stackTrace) => logger.e(error.toString()),
  );
}
```

---

## Conclusion

* We talked about setting up Flutter project folders for Clean Architecture, including project setup, dependencies, and how to organize folders for core, features, and other key parts.
    
* We discussed the domain, data, and presentation layers, highlighting their role in Clean Architecture.
    
* We explored managing states with flutter\_bloc, how to set up dependencies, and how to build a responsive and easy-to-maintain app structure.
    
* We also covered dependency injection, routing, and essential features like networking and error handling, giving a full guide on applying Clean Architecture in Flutter projects.
    

---

## In the next blog...

* We've gone through everything important about Clean Architecture, from the basic ideas and uses to organizing the project.
    
* Now, it's time to start coding, isn't it?
    
* In the next article, the last one in this Clean Architecture series, we'll build an app from the ground up using Clean Architecture concepts.
